# Cloud Computing for Programmers

## Course Description

This course builds on knowledge gained in previous courses and provides an overview of important software development, testing, and deployment practices in the cloud. The popularity of cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and others has changed the way that software developers write, test, and deploy their applications. Many new technologies, architectural patterns, tools, and best practices have evolved along with the capabilities of the cloud. Through hands-on labs and real-world projects, students will explore modern approaches to building distributed, reliable, and scalable applications in the cloud.
